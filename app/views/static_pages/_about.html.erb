                <h2>About</h2>
                <p class="lead">I am a graduate from New York University with a degree in Music Technology.</p>
                <p class="lead">Over the past 4 years I have worked hard to learn everything I can about music, technology, and the industry. Throughout this process I have picked up many valuable skills, including soldlering, signal flow, and equipment maintenance.</p>
                <p class="lead">During my time at school I built a brand around my own music productions and have since cultivated over 2,00 followers. My productions can be found on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/officialsycko" target="_blank">soundcloud</a>, or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/34t9h1WiaXc9H5wm2yjqMA" target="_blank">spotify</a>, and have been played across the world more than 200,000 times.
                <p class="lead">In addition to being a musician, I am also an aspiring junior Rails developer, with a focus on back end development. I have knowledge in various aspects of software developement including Ruby, Git, Rails, Heroku, HTML, and Arduino. Examples of my software can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/sycko" target="_blank">github</a>; including a <a href="https://github.com/sycko/sample_app" target="_blank">sample application</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/sycko/warehouse_app" target="_blank">warehouse application</a>.</p>
