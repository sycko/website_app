                <p class="lead">Shortly after the pandemic hit, I began at <a href="https://www.yext.com/" target="_blank">Yext</a> as a remote IT Engineer. In this role I handle many facets of the company's internal systems. On a daily basis I resolve various issues ranging from simple user provisioning to more complex integrations to improve company processes and workflows.

This position focused heavily on heading new system integrations and building new business partnerships to streamline company management. I was also responisble for the automation of workflows and increasing efficiency. In addition to these responsibilities I oversaw the smooth operation of both internal and third-party systems.</p>
                <p class="lead">From 2014 to 2017 I worked as a technician for the <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/technology" target="_blank">Music Technology</a> department of Steinhardt School of Culture and Education located within New York Univeristy. There I built my knowledge of signal flow, soldering, troubleshooting, studio construction, and studio maintenance. This position was predominantly in charge of the day to day operations of the graduate floor of the department. Requiring routine studio maintenance and upkeep, class and conference setup, troubleshooting, and equipment repair.</p>

This role built my knowledge of session setup and strike, client relations, console management, and further deepened my skills in equipment repair.
